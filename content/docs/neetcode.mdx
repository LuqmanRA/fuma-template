# 🧑‍💻 NeetCode Learning Summary

NeetCode is a well-known platform for mastering data structures and algorithms, especially for coding interview preparation. Here’s a summary of what I have learned so far.

## 🚩 Why NeetCode?

- Provides a **structured roadmap** for problem solving.
- Covers **most frequently asked** patterns in coding interviews.
- Focuses on **understanding patterns**, not just solving problems mechanically.

## 🧰 Key Topics Learned

### Arrays & Hashing

- Mastered **two-pointer techniques**, sliding window, and hash maps to solve common problems efficiently.
- Learned to handle problems like:
  - Two Sum
  - Group Anagrams
  - Contains Duplicate
  - Top K Frequent Elements

### Two Pointers

- Improved skills in optimizing array and string problems using left/right pointers.
- Example problems:
  - Valid Palindrome
  - Three Sum
  - Trapping Rain Water

### Sliding Window

- Learned how to maintain a window to achieve optimal time complexity.
- Example problems:
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Minimum Window Substring

### Stack

- Learned how to use stacks for parsing expressions, evaluating next greater elements, and validating parentheses.
- Example problems:
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Min Stack
  - Daily Temperatures

## 💬 What I Felt & Learned Beyond Algorithms

While learning from NeetCode, I didn’t just learn to solve problems — I also learned how to **code correctly and cleanly**.

- **Writing clean code**: I started paying attention to code readability and simplicity.
- **Proper naming**: I learned how to name variables and functions clearly so that the code is easy to understand and maintain, not only for myself but also for other people who might read it in the future.
- **Code as communication**: I realized that writing code isn’t just about making it work, but also about making it understandable.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Solving problems is not just about finding any solution but writing **efficient, readable, and maintainable code**.
- NeetCode helps build strong foundations and teaches important coding habits beyond algorithm knowledge.
- Practicing regularly improves both problem-solving skills and overall coding style.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Continue solving advanced problems and new patterns.
- Practice explaining solutions clearly to strengthen interview skills.
- Start doing timed mock interviews to simulate real interview environments.
