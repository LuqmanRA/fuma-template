## 🧑‍💻 What is NeetCode?

NeetCode is a well-known platform for mastering data structures and algorithms, especially for preparing for coding interviews. In this documentation, I summarize what I have learned so far by solving various problems and studying different patterns.

## 🚩 Why NeetCode?

- Provides a **structured roadmap** to learn and practice problem-solving effectively.
- Covers **commonly asked** patterns and problems in coding interviews.
- Emphasizes **understanding problem-solving patterns**, not just memorizing solutions.

## 🛠️ How I Used This Documentation

- To **track my progress** and reflect on each problem I solved.
- As a **personal reference** when revisiting certain patterns or problems later.
- To help others who want to learn from my approach and solutions.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Solving problems isn’t just about getting any solution — it’s about writing **efficient, clean, and maintainable code**.
- NeetCode helps strengthen fundamental knowledge and encourages good coding practices beyond algorithm mastery.
- Regular practice improves both problem-solving skills and overall coding style, including better variable naming and code organization.

## ✨ Additional Benefits

- Improved **analytical thinking** and the ability to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Built confidence in tackling unknown problems under time constraints, similar to real interview situations.
- Learned to recognize **common patterns** (such as sliding window, two pointers, and backtracking) more quickly and apply them more effectively.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

I believe learning through solving real problems is the best way to grow as a developer. This documentation is not just a record of solutions but also a reflection of my growth mindset and dedication to continuous improvement.
